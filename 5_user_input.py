# user input is defined by the function:
input("What is your name?: ")

# programme will wait for us to enter an input and then press enter

# to assign the answer to a variable we can do this:
name = input("What is your name?: ")
print("Hello " + name)

age = int(input("How old are you?: "))
age = age + 1
print("You are " + str(age) + " years old")

# Here we have to change age to an integer in order to perform calculations and then back to a string to concatenate
