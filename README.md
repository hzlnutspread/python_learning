<h1>Python Learning Journey</h1>

Hi friends! Since I've already started doing python projects before learning the basics, I've decided to go back and learn from the beginning to make sure I don't have any holes in my theory. 

I anticipate that as things get harder, a strong grasp of the basics will be very important to have.

This repo will also double as my own library so if I ever forget how to do something or why something works, I can refer back here for any topic I want to have a refresher on.

Expect to see this repo updated a few times a week.
